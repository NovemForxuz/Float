# What is Float?
Float is a mobile app project done by 11 Information Engineering and Media (IEM) students for their Design & Innovation Project module at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The objective of the app was to give students better methods of coping with their mental wellbeing as well as provide meaningful metrics to track the student's progress.

We take references and inspiration from the [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com) app while giving some little twist with our space-themed design and gamification experiences. For now, we only support Android.

# How was it done?
Our team used [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) to develop the frontend on the android platform. [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) was used to build a mobile with a serverless architecture.

# Why was it difficult?
This is an extremely challenging project, because we are a group of randomly selected students with different technological experience. Tasked to built a mobile app with limited experience and a fixed time frame of 13 weeks, with complexity ranging from implementing a global state container using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started), integrating multiple services on the AWS cloud and the UI/UX design considerations using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
